      There’s a lot of scattered information on the internet for learning about
      OAuth, what OpenID connect is, and how to use them in our modern SPA apps
      infrastructure. Most of the guides I found were solely relying on the
      corresponding client libraries. For example, using the JS SDK for
      Microsoft Azure login increases the bundle size by 71KB( 18KB gzipped).
      The same is true for other libs like Facebook SDK JS and Google’s gapi.
      While looking for solutions when we were asked about adding a Google or FB
      login button in our web app, we tend to find a framework-compatible
      wrapper that does the magic for us, without even bothering to understand
      what that library is doing internally. We simply look for guides or
      tutorials on how to quickly integrate it without looking at the security
      implications of choosing one strategy over the other. For example, we
      retrieve the access token and unknowingly or knowingly gain access to the
      user’s personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      See this, netmeds, a medicine delivery app, asks for permission to access
      all the user’s email contacts, for what? And, sadly, gullible people won’t
      even bother to note such things in a rush of signing into the app for
      ordering medicines! The above case is on the user’s end. On the
      developer’s end, we all tend to grab the access token even when we just
      need to identify the user info, like email ID and basic profile info, then
      we store the access token in the localstorage and send it in the request
      header of every request. Storing an access token in client storage makes
      it prone to script injection attacks. I’m sure you might have come across
      situations while developing where you’ve asked your colleagues to share
      their access token with you to log into the app. Anyone with your access
      token can impersonate you and perform actions on your behalf and that
      actually breaks the principle of C (Confidentiality) of the CIA Triad
      model of information security, which says that the access to the resource
      should be available to the right person only and no one should be able to
      impersonate any other user.

      Agenda We’ll be discussing: Authentication vs. authorization. OAuth 2.0
      and its flows. Implementing authorization code grant flow with OpenID in a
      React app with popup and redirection UX. Implementing OAuth flow on a
      Node.js server using Koa. WebAuthn. Throughout the discussion, we won’t be
      using any third-party library to understand the concepts fully.
      Authentication vs. Authorization Authentication means that we only want to
      identify the user who’s trying to log into an application. It’s a way of
      identifying the users to make sure they are who they are claiming to be. A
      simple example is a username/password. The naive assumption is that all
      usernames and passwords are unique. If a person has these things, they can
      claim to be a certain person. These days, we have two or multi-factor
      authentication systems in place, they are a little annoying, however, but
      very important for protecting your identity. Image for post Authorization,
      on the other hand, is a way of “authorizing” the logged-in user to access
      the protected resources. The authorization process generally succeeds
      authentication. An example would be an API key through which you can
      access the developer’s REST API. Or, simply something like a Google access
      token to access Google resources, such as Google Drive. Once you have
      gained the token during the authentication process, anyone with it can
      access your Google Drive until it expires. A good analogy for
      authorization is a movie ticket, particularly in the old days. Anyone with
      a ticket can get into the movie theatre. One could sell it around to other
      people because the identity of the person who bought it doesn’t matter
      here. In the same way, concert tickets or passes can be sold to other
      people easily because they are used only for checking the authorization to
      enter the venue. On the other hand, authentication is like showing your
      driving license to the police to confirm your identity, that you are
      actually the person you are claiming to be. The cop will verify your
      identity by checking your information, such as biological characteristics
      and your photo, and can question if they doubt any of these things. In the
      same way, while logging in through Google OAuth, Google is the cop outside
      the airport trying to identify you by checking your username and password,
      along with additional factors like MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication). When
      you prove your identity with the above methods, the cop gives you an
      “access token”, say, a virtual entry pass to the airport to access various
      airport resources. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID These two complement each other.
      OpenID is a protocol for authentication while OAuth is for authorization.
      OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol,
      controlled by the OpenID foundation. OAuth is an open standard for access
      delegation. OpenID Connect (OIDC) combines the features of OpenID and
      OAuth, i.e. it does both authentication and authorization. OIDC uses
      simple JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which you can obtain using flows conforming
      to the OAuth 2.0 specifications. OAuth is directly related to OIDC as OIDC
      is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google and other providers implement both OpenID and OAuth specs. Hence,
      we can authenticate and authorize the user at the same time. For example,
      if you chose to sign in to Auth0 using your Google account then you used
      OIDC. Once you successfully authenticate with Google and authorize Auth0
      to access your information, Google will send back to Auth0 information
      about the user and the authentication performed. This information is
      returned in a JSON Web Token (JWT). You’ll receive an access token and, if
      requested, an ID token. OAuth 2.0 Flows There are various flows to achieve
      authentication and authorization using OIDC. Below are the two main ones:
      1. Implicit grant flow

        import React, { FC, useEffect } from "react";
import { RouteComponentProps } from "react-router";

import { Google, Azure } from "./config";

const LoginCallback: FC<RouteComponentProps> = ({ location }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const code = (location.search.match(/code=([^&]+)/) || [])[1];
    const state = (location.search.match(/state=([^&]+)/) || [])[1];
    const qParams = [
      `code=${code}`,
      `redirect_uri=${
      state === "google" ? Google.REDIRECT_URI : Azure.REDIRECT_URI
      }`,
      `scope=${state === "google" ? Google.SCOPE : Azure.SCOPE}`
    ].join("&");
    fetch(`/api/auth-from-code/${state}?${qParams}`, {
      credentials: "include"
    })
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(res => console.log(res))
      .catch(console.error);
  }, []);

  return <p>
    {location.search}
  </p>;
};

export default LoginCallback;
